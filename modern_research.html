                            The investigation of the Polish archaeological mission in Khirbat as-Sar in 2018 and 2019, conducted on behalf of the PCMA, ended due to the Coronavirus-19 pandemic. A new research project enabling the resumption of field research did not begin until 2022, this time on behalf of the Faculty of Archaeology, University of Warsaw, and with funding from the National Science Centre (UMO 2021/43/B/HS3/00813). So far, two seasons of excavations have taken place.

<h2 id="section-66">Season 2023</h2>
<p id="paragraph-74">The archaeological team directed by Mariusz Burdajewicz and Jolanta Młynarczyk from the Faculty of Archaeology started a new excavation project in Khirbat as-Sar between 30 April and 27 May 2023 (Excavation Permit no. 2023/12). Three trenches (T1/1, T1/3, and T2-S) were opened in the eastern part of the courtyard of the architectural compound preliminary identified as a Roman-period sanctuary. Trenches T1/1 and T1/T3 formed an L-shaped unit in the northeastern part of the courtyard. Topographically, they have been extensions of the trenches made in 2019 (Sq1 and Sq3). Trench 2-S was opened in the southeastern part of the compound, while a new trench, T4, was on the northern side of the “Ammonite tower”

<p id="paragraph-75">
                                Trench 1/1 is a westward extension of Sq1 on the western side of the N-S wall (W01), which was excavated in 2019 and identified as an Islamic addition to a Roman-period construction. This wall exhibited two clear phases: one with a doorway and another with the door's blockage. The final phase of the settlement is associated with an earthen floor 
                                (<button alt="Fig. 2.

<p id="paragraph-76">
                                The sequence of walls and floors has been evident. Under a Mamluk period habitation phase, there was a Byzantine-to-Early Islamic floor in a room spanned by an arch supported by two pillars on its northern and southern sides, respectively 
                                (<button alt="Fig. 3.

                                 the room's eastern limit is unknown. The south wall of that room has been resting on a Roman period wall, possibly by a gate leading to the sanctuary courtyard. The lowermost level reached in this Trench should be dated to the Roman period. Along the southern foundation offset of an East-West wall, the tops of the slabs made a horizontal surface.
                            </p>
<p id="paragraph-77">
                                In contrast, in the remainder of the Trench, the fill was made up of an uneven mass of boulders 
                                (<button alt="Fig. 4. Floor F009 in T1/1: stone pavement(?) in the southern part, and fill of boulders to the north; view from the east (image by Mariusz Burdajewicz)" class="badge clickable-badge" data-bs-image="assets/images/current_project/fig._4._roman_floor-rgb.jpg" data-bs-target="#imageModal" data-bs-toggle="modal" type="button">Fig. 4</button>). 
                                Unfortunately, the ceramic material from the lowermost contexts contained only a few diagnostic pieces and no fine wares at all that would provide more detailed dating. Under the Trench's western section, the lowest course of an N-S wall is visible, and its destination and chronology are to be examined in the feature.

                                    This Trench was between T1/1 in the south and the small Trench Sq3 of 2019  in the northwest. All these trenches were eventually merged into one. In T1/T3, the occupational levels were accompanied by several architectural features, sometimes blending, rendering their phasing more complicated. The uppermost earthen floor, with traces of two fireplaces, many animal bones, and hand-made pottery, including several examples of Hand-made Geometric Painted (HMGP) ware, was associated with walls constructed of boulders with a few reused architectural elements

                                Under the uppermost level of the early Ottoman period, the next habitation level included two roughly square ‘compartments’ S14 delineated by stones in the northern part of the Trench

                                 and a tamped earth floor in the southern part. Inside the southern one of the two “compartments” S14, among burning traces, were remains of a large pithos of an exceptionally low-fired fabric. Connected with this phase (Mamluk) are abundant finds of HMGP ware and glazed ware pottery

                                To sum up, it seems inevitable that Trench T1/3 was an industrial area rather than a habitation one, at least during the Early Islamic period. All the Roman structures, the traces we identified within this Trench, were extensively reused throughout all the later phases. The tentative chronological sequence in trench T1/T3 is as follows: Late(?) Roman (Byzantine?) period; Early Islamic period; Ayyubid-Mamluk period; Mamluk II period; Mamluk/Ottoman period.

<p id="paragraph-86">Trench 2-S was opened on the southern side of the Roman-period arch, whose northern side was examined and stratified in 2019 (Sq2). The goal in 2023 was to study the stratigraphy in the space between the arch and the southern E-W wall of the compound. Unfortunately, this task could not have been accomplished due to the presence of dense debris of blocks collapsed from a barrel vault and walls of a large room

                                However, it was filled with the construction of a buttress consisting mainly of unworked boulders built to support this particular section of the Ammonite structure where a convex deformation of its northern wall had occurred.

<p id="paragraph-90">The date of this intervention can be established based on the latest pottery forms in the repertoire of the well-known Eastern Sigillata A (ESA) ware

                                This means that the buttress was built by the Romans around the mid-2nd century CE, possibly indicating the very period when the "Ammonite tower" was transformed into the <i>cella</i> of the temple.

<p id="paragraph-91">
                                Except for the early Roman pottery, the construction of the buttress yielded an amount of Hellenistic pottery, securely dated to the 2nd century BCE

                                and many fragments of Iron Age storage jars

                                All these ceramics are unstratified and dispersed throughout all the mechanical layers recorded during the exploration. Yet, they provide evidence of the occupation of the area of Khirbat as-Sar in the Iron Age II, as well as in the Hellenistic period.

<h4 class="fw-normal pt-5" id="section-71">Summary</h4>
<p id="paragraph-92">
                                The 2023 exploration results in the eastern part of the Roman-period courtyard testify to a dense habitation of the site, especially in the Middle Islamic period when the Roman structures were extensively reused. Moreover, during this season, levels of the early Islamic and late Roman/Byzantine periods were identified for the first time. The chronological sequence presented above is preliminary; its detailed phasing is rendered difficult by the repeated reuse of walls and structures of all consecutive periods attested at the site. As to the "Ammonite tower", despite the presence of several Iron Age storage jar fragments (and other ceramic forms) in the fills associated with the buttress, the exact date of its construction remains obscure.
