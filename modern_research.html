                        <p >
                            The investigation of the Polish archaeological mission in Khirbat as-Sar in 2018 and 2019, conducted on behalf of the PCMA, ended due to the Coronavirus-19 pandemic. A new research project enabling the resumption of field research did not begin until 2022, this time on behalf of the Faculty of Archaeology, University of Warsaw, and with funding from the National Science Centre (UMO 2021/43/B/HS3/00813). So far, two seasons of excavations have taken place.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Season 2023</h2>
                        <p>The archaeological team directed by Mariusz Burdajewicz and Jolanta Młynarczyk from the Faculty of Archaeology started a new excavation project in Khirbat as-Sar between 30 April and 27 May 2023 (Excavation Permit no. 2023/12). Three trenches (T1/1, T1/3, and T2-S) were opened in the eastern part of the courtyard of the architectural compound preliminary identified as a Roman-period sanctuary. Trenches T1/1 and T1/T3 formed an L-shaped unit in the northeastern part of the courtyard. Topographically, they have been extensions of the trenches made in 2019 (Sq1 and Sq3). Trench 2-S was opened in the southeastern part of the compound, while a new trench, T4, was on the northern side of the “Ammonite tower”

                                Trench 1/1 is a westward extension of Sq1 on the western side of the N-S wall (W01), which was excavated in 2019 and identified as an Islamic addition to a Roman-period construction. This wall exhibited two clear phases: one with a doorway and another with the door's blockage. The final phase of the settlement is associated with an earthen floor

                                The sequence of walls and floors has been evident. Under a Mamluk period habitation phase, there was a Byzantine-to-Early Islamic floor in a room spanned by an arch supported by two pillars on its northern and southern sides, respectively

                                 the room's eastern limit is unknown. The south wall of that room has been resting on a Roman period wall, possibly by a gate leading to the sanctuary courtyard. The lowermost level reached in this Trench should be dated to the Roman period. Along the southern foundation offset of an East-West wall, the tops of the slabs made a horizontal surface.

                                In contrast, in the remainder of the Trench, the fill was made up of an uneven mass of boulders

                                Unfortunately, the ceramic material from the lowermost contexts contained only a few diagnostic pieces and no fine wares at all that would provide more detailed dating. Under the Trench's western section, the lowest course of an N-S wall is visible, and its destination and chronology are to be examined in the feature.

                                This Trench was between T1/1 in the south and the small Trench Sq3 of 2019  in the northwest. All these trenches were eventually merged into one. In T1/T3, the occupational levels were accompanied by several architectural features, sometimes blending, rendering their phasing more complicated. The uppermost earthen floor, with traces of two fireplaces, many animal bones, and hand-made pottery, including several examples of Hand-made Geometric Painted (HMGP) ware, was associated with walls constructed of boulders with a few reused architectural elements

Inside the southern one of the two “compartments” S14, among burning traces, were remains of a large pithos of an exceptionally low-fired fabric. Connected with this phase (Mamluk) are abundant finds of HMGP ware and glazed ware pottery

                                On the northern side of S14, another earthen floor(Ayyubid-Mamluk) with a fireplace (F077) has been recorded. The stone material upon it included a limestone column base that, before having been incorporated into the wall, was reused probably as a door post or perhaps a mortarium

                                The level below the Mamluk-Ayyubid phase belonged to the Early Islamic period and included two main architectural features. The first, “Compartment” S15, is a strong box-like construction of ashlars with a frame of undressed or semi-dressed stones on the top

                                To sum up, it seems inevitable that Trench T1/3 was an industrial area rather than a habitation one, at least during the Early Islamic period. All the Roman structures, the traces we identified within this Trench, were extensively reused throughout all the later phases. The tentative chronological sequence in trench T1/T3 is as follows: Late(?) Roman (Byzantine?) period; Early Islamic period; Ayyubid-Mamluk period; Mamluk II period; Mamluk/Ottoman period.
