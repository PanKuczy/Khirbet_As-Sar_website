The upper floor, probably contemporary with the blocking of the door, seems to have been from the Mamluk period.

Today the site is located on the western outskirts of Amman, between wadis descending towards the south and west. From the later 8th cent.

        "content": "The first reference to the site as \"Khurbet Sar\" was made in 1877 r. by S. Merrill (1881, 404-405), who situated it in the Jazer region (“Jazer plateau”) to the west of Amman (“the great plateau north and east of Sar”), where “Wady esh Shita descends rapidly on the south”. Soon after that, in 1881, it was visited by C.R. Conder (1889, 153), who described it as a large site, situated on “the ancient west road from Amman”. By the northern side of this road, “six sarcophagi were found lying in a square enclosure”, which must be a reference to a built tomb outside the limits of the settlement. Conder describes the tower, built “of great blocks of chert or flint\", and to the east of it, he notes “remains of a building with two parallel rows of arches”, remarking that “the piers beneath the arches are covered up” which means that the appearance of the courtyard has not changed since the 19th century till now. He notes that “the face of each arch is ornamented with mouldings (as in the structural tombs of Amman)”, supposing therefore that the building had a funerary function. He also mentions “a large pool or Birkeh in the ruins”, \"masonry of Roman appearance”, and concludes with assigning a Roman date for the site.",

Butler (1919, 33, ill. 21), who specified that it was situated “at the very top of the mountain range between the Wadi is-Sir and the Wadi Amman”. His description focused on the square structure (the \"qasr\") “surrounded by a mass of broken and half-buried walls of rude workmanship and of various ages, from the period of considerable antiquity to a comparatively late Mohammedan date”. He noted dimensions and appearance of the central structure \"of great antiquity, probably a shrine, which was renovated or restored by builders of the Roman period\" as well as a courtyard to the east of it, flanked by two rows of arcades (called by him arcosolia), seven arches in each row.",

In his topographical description, Glueck emphasizes the strategic qualities of the site which “nears the w. edge of the plateau overlooking the descent to the Jordan River valley” (…). “Situated at the top of the gradual slope from the east to the west, at a height of 972 m, it occupies the highest point in the vicinity and commands an excellent view over much of the surrounding country-side”. In Glueck's opinion, the square structure was initially a fortress, which was transformed by the Romans into (presumably) a temple by adding a \"platform\" on its eastern side, preceded by the arcaded courtyard. Other site elements mentioned by Glueck were “numerous large, now filled-up cisterns and cave cisterns around the site”, as well as \"remains of considerable settlement on the s.e. side of the qasr, and also on the n.e. side, where there are also the remains of the small reservoir”.",

Among them was Khirbet es-Sar (Sites 11 and 12). In addition to the description, they included four photographs and a sketch of the tower and arcades (Petrie 1952, 41, XLVIII, L: 14-17).",

BC, the site must have been a part of the region administered by the mighty family of Tobiads, suggesting its possible identification with \"Birta of the Ammanitis\", mentioned in a letter from the Zeno Archive, dated to 259 BC.
