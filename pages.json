The previously discovered and treated part of the mosaic remained in good condition and was relatively clean. It was thoroughly inspected once the secondary soil was removed entirely. All mortar bands applied in 2023 remained stable and coherent. No new losses or disintegrated edges were noted within the previously treated area. Conservation treatments were carried out in order to stabilize the condition of the newly discovered parts of the mosaic. At the end of the 2024 season, the mosaic was covered with the same synthetic sturdy mat as the previous year and reburied with a thick layer of soil (80-90 cm) \n                            (Fig. 4).",

The chronological sequence presented above is preliminary; its detailed phasing is rendered difficult by the repeated reuse of walls and structures of all consecutive periods attested at the site.

For the first time, we have recorded a complete sequence of Islamic occupation phases from the Umayyad through the Abbasid, Fatimid, Ayyubid, and Mamluk periods, possibly reaching into the early Ottoman times. More difficulty has been detailed in distinguishing the pre-Islamic periods, although indications of the Byzantine, Roman, and Hellenistic phases are pretty eloquent. The site’s occupation during the Hellenistic period has been confirmed by finding both details of monumental architecture and ceramic fine wares, among them imports from local and western trading centers. Based on the pottery, the Hellenistic occupation is probably the second half of the 2nd century BCE. Although evidenced by architecture and pottery, the Roman period cannot be satisfactorily divided between the early Roman and late Roman phases. The same should be said about the transition from the late Roman/Byzantine to the early Islamic/Umayyad period.",

This observation corresponds with recorded anomalies of electrical resistance. The terraces strongly affected the relics of earlier architecture; nevertheless, high-resistance linear anomalies potentially reflect the remains of older phases of the settlement.",

New government administration started working to spread the systematic care of antiquities. In the DoA archives (vol. S: p. 20 [unpublished]), there is a short note left by G.L. Harding (director of the DoA from 1939 to 1956) dedicated to a site \n                                    (Fig. 1):",

Merrill (1881, 404-405), who situated it in the Jazer region (\"Jazer plateau\") to the west of Amman (\"the great plateau north and east of Sar\"), where \"Wady esh Shita descends rapidly on the south\". Soon after that, in 1881, it was visited by C.R. Conder (1889, 153), who described it as a large site on \"the ancient west road from Amman.\" By the northern side of this road, \"six sarcophagi were found lying in a square enclosure,\" which must be a reference to a built tomb outside the limits of the settlement. Conder describes the tower as built \"of great blocks of chert or flint.\" To the east of it, he notes \"remains of a building with two parallel rows of arches,\" remarking that \"the piers beneath the arches are covered up\" which means that the appearance of the courtyard has not changed since the 19th century till now. He notes that \"the face of each arch is ornamented with moldings (as in the structural tombs of Amman),\" supposing that the building had a funerary function. He also mentions \"a large pool or Birkeh in the ruins\" and \"masonry of Roman appearance\" and concludes by assigning a Roman date for the site.",

His description focused on the square structure (the \"qasr\") \"surrounded by a mass of broken and half-buried walls of rude workmanship and various ages, from the period of considerable antiquity to a comparatively late Mohammedan date.\" He noted dimensions and appearance of the central structure \"of great antiquity, probably a shrine, which was renovated or restored by builders of the Roman period\" as well as a courtyard to the east of it, flanked by two rows of arcades (called by him arcosolia), seven arches in each row.",

In his topographical description, Glueck emphasizes the strategic qualities of the site, which \"nears the w. edge of the plateau overlooking the descent to the Jordan River valley\" (…). \"Situated at the top of the gradual slope from the east to the west, at a height of 972 m, it occupies the highest point in the vicinity and commands an excellent view over much of the surrounding countryside\". In Glueck's opinion, the square structure was built as a fortress, which was transformed by the Romans into (presumably) a temple by adding a \"platform\" on its eastern side, preceded by the arcaded courtyard. Other site elements mentioned by Glueck were \"numerous large, now filled-up cisterns and cave cisterns around the site,\" as well as \"remains of considerable settlement on the s.e. side of the qasr, and also on the n.e. side, where there are also the remains of the small reservoir”.",
