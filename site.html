                        is a site in the southwest part of "the land of the
                        children of Ammon," <i>b'ne Ammon</i> (Judges 11.13).
                        This biblical narrative generally refers to the Amman
                        Plateau (in more recent times also known as the Belqa,
                        or "empty" land), a territory inhabited by a
                        semi-nomadic people that became an independent tribal
                        kingdom of Ammonites at the turn of the 2nd and the 1st
                        millennium BC. Today, the site is located on the western
                        outskirts of Amman, between wadis descending towards the
                        south and west, from the later 8th century. BC on, this
                        region belonged in turns to the empires of Assyria (as a
                        vassal kingdom), Babylonia and Persia, the Ptolemies,
                        Seleucids, Hasmoneans, the Romans, and Byzantines, until
                        its conquest by the Muslims in AD 636.

                        site is located on the western outskirts of Amman,
                        between wadis descending towards the south and west,
                        from the later 8th century. BC on, this region belonged
                        in turns to the empires of Assyria (as a vassal
                        kingdom), Babylonia and Persia, the Ptolemies,
                        Seleucids, Hasmoneans, the Romans, and Byzantines, until
                        its conquest by the Muslims in AD 636.

                Khirbet es-Sar in the accounts of 19th and 20th century
                travellers
              </h2>
              <p id="paragraph-248">
                The first reference to the site as "Khurbet Sar" was made in
                1877 r. by S. Merrill (1881, 404-405), who situated it in the
                Jazer region ("Jazer plateau") to the west of Amman ("the great
                plateau north and east of Sar"), where "Wady esh Shita descends
                rapidly on the south". Soon after that, in 1881, it was visited
                by C.R. Conder (1889, 153), who described it as a large site on
                "the ancient west road from Amman." By the northern side of this
                road, "six sarcophagi were found lying in a square enclosure,"
                which must be a reference to a built tomb outside the limits of
                the settlement. Conder describes the tower as built "of great
                blocks of chert or flint." To the east of it, he notes "remains
                of a building with two parallel rows of arches," remarking that
                "the piers beneath the arches are covered up" which means that
                the appearance of the courtyard has not changed since the 19th
                century till now. He notes that "the face of each arch is
                ornamented with moldings (as in the structural tombs of Amman),"
                supposing that the building had a funerary function. He also
                mentions "a large pool or Birkeh in the ruins" and "masonry of
                Roman appearance" and concludes by assigning a Roman date for
                the site.

                  The next visitor to Khirbat as-Sar, in 1905, was H.C. Butler
                  (1919, 33, ill. 21), who specified that it was situated "at
                  the very top of the mountain range between the Wadi is-Sir and
                  the Wadi Amman". His description focused on the square
                  structure (the "qasr") "surrounded by a mass of broken and
                  half-buried walls of rude workmanship and various ages, from
                  the period of considerable antiquity to a comparatively late
                  Mohammedan date." He noted dimensions and appearance of the
                  central structure "of great antiquity, probably a shrine,
                  which was renovated or restored by builders of the Roman
                  period" as well as a courtyard to the east of it, flanked by
                  two rows of arcades (called by him <i>arcosolia</i>), seven
                  arches in each row.

                  In 1937, the site was visited by N. Glueck (1939, 153-56, site
                  no. 207), who knew it by the name of "Qasr es-Sar". In his
                  topographical description, Glueck emphasizes the strategic
                  qualities of the site, which "nears the w. edge of the plateau
                  overlooking the descent to the Jordan River valley" (…).
                  "Situated at the top of the gradual slope from the east to the
                  west, at a height of 972 m, it occupies the highest point in
                  the vicinity and commands an excellent view over much of the
                  surrounding countryside". In Glueck's opinion, the square
                  structure was built as a fortress, which was transformed by
                  the Romans into (presumably) a temple by adding a "platform"
                  on its eastern side, preceded by the arcaded courtyard. Other
                  site elements mentioned by Glueck were "numerous large, now
                  filled-up cisterns and cave cisterns around the site," as well
                  as "remains of considerable settlement on the s.e. side of
                  the <i>qasr</i>, and also on the n.e. side, where there are
                  also the remains of the small reservoir”.

                    It is also noteworthy that the "Ammonite tableland" was of
                    interest to Sir Flinders Petrie's expedition. In 1938, after
                    his last campaign in Gaza, two team members explored several
                    ruins near Amman, mainly those with the remains of towers.
                    Among them was Khirbet es-Sar (Sites 11 and 12). In addition
                    to the description, they included four photographs and a
                    sketch of the tower and arcades (Petrie 1952, 41, XLVIII, L:
                    14-17).

                The site's ancient identity remains obscure. Merrill (1881) and

                Conder (1889) maintained this view, stating that the site was
                probably the same as Azor in the <i>Onomastikon</i> of Eusebius

                    Indeed, the geographical situation and some archaeological
                    evidence for habitation during the Hellenistic period might
                    suggest the identity of Kh. Sar with the fortified
                    settlement of Jazer, conquered by Judah Maccabee in 163 BC
                    (I Macc. 5,8). Under the Ptolemies, in the 3rd century. BC,
                    the site must have been part of the region administered by
                    the mighty family of Tobiads, suggesting its possible
                    identification with "Birta of the Ammanitis," mentioned in a
                    letter from the Zeno Archive, dated to 259 BC. (see
                    discussion in Młynarczyk, Burdajewicz 2018, 359-360).
