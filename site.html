<h2 id="section-151">Khirbet es-Sar in the accounts of 19th and 20th century travellers</h2>
<p class="" id="paragraph-157">The first reference to the site as "Khurbet Sar" was made in 1877 r. by S. Merrill (1881, 404-405), who situated it in the Jazer region (“Jazer plateau”) to the west of Amman (“the great plateau north and east of Sar”), where “Wady esh Shita descends rapidly on the south”. Soon after that, in 1881, it was visited by C.R. Conder (1889, 153), who described it as a large site, situated on “the ancient west road from Amman”. By the northern side of this road, “six sarcophagi were found lying in a square enclosure”, which must be a reference to a built tomb outside the limits of the settlement. Conder describes the tower, built “of great blocks of chert or flint", and to the east of it, he notes “remains of a building with two parallel rows of arches”, remarking that “the piers beneath the arches are covered up” which means that the appearance of the courtyard has not changed since the 19th century till now. He notes that “the face of each arch is ornamented with mouldings (as in the structural tombs of Amman)”, supposing therefore that the building had a funerary function. He also mentions “a large pool or Birkeh in the ruins”, "masonry of Roman appearance”, and concludes with assigning a Roman date for the site. </p>

<p id="paragraph-158">The next visitor to Khirbat as-Sar, in 1905, was H.C. Butler (1919, 33, ill. 21), who specified that it was situated “at the very top of the mountain range between the Wadi is-Sir and the Wadi Amman”. His description focused on the square structure (the "qasr") “surrounded by a mass of broken and half-buried walls of rude workmanship and of various ages, from the period of considerable antiquity to a comparatively late Mohammedan date”. He noted dimensions and appearance of the central structure "of great antiquity, probably a shrine, which was renovated or restored by builders of the Roman period" as well as a courtyard to the east of it, flanked by two rows of arcades (called by him <i>arcosolia</i>), seven arches in each row. </p>

<p id="paragraph-159">In 1937, the site was visited by N. Glueck (1939, 153-56, site no. 207), who knew it by the name of "Qasr es-Sar". In his topographical description, Glueck emphasizes the strategic qualities of the site which “nears the w. edge of the plateau overlooking the descent to the Jordan River valley” (…). “Situated at the top of the gradual slope from the east to the west, at a height of 972 m, it occupies the highest point in the vicinity and commands an excellent view over much of the surrounding country-side”. In Glueck's opinion, the square structure was initially a fortress, which was transformed by the Romans into (presumably) a temple by adding a "platform" on its eastern side, preceded by the arcaded courtyard. Other site elements mentioned by Glueck were “numerous large, now filled-up cisterns and cave cisterns around the site”, as well as "remains of considerable settlement on the s.e. side of the <i>qasr</i>, and also on the n.e. side, where there are also the remains of the small reservoir”.  </p>

<p id="paragraph-160">It is also noteworthy that the "Ammonite tableland" was of interest to Sir Flinders Petrie's expedition. In 1938, after his last campaign in Gaza, two members of his team explored several ruins in the vicinity of Amman, mainly those with the remains of towers. Among them was Khirbet es-Sar (Sites 11 and 12). In addition to the description, they included four photographs and a sketch of the tower and arcades (Petrie 1952, 41, XLVIII, L: 14-17).</p>
<p id="paragraph-161">It is interesting to note how Petrie himself interpreted the remains of the arcades:</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p id="paragraph-162">„ a hall about 60 ft. long, with seven windows in each side. These are round-headed, with a continuous moulding (…). This can scarcely be anything but a church. At the west end is a square building with pieces of columns, and a cistern, and this is evidently the baptistery, separate as in early Italian churches. The date is indicated by pottery scattered around, of about A.D. 300. This was, then, a church of Constantine age, ruined by the Arab invasion”. </p>

<h2 id="section-152">Identification of the site</h2>
<p id="paragraph-163">The site's ancient identity remains obscure. Both Merrill (1881) and Conder (1889) would identify  it with the biblical Jazer. C.R. Conder (1889) maintained this view, stating that the site was probably the same as Azor in the <i>Onomastikon</i> of Eusebius of the 4th century AD (s.v. Azōr (Iazer):</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p id="paragraph-164">"Boundary of the children of Ammon" (border city of Ammon) which is called Philadelphia now. (…). There is eight miles (about) from Philadelphia a village Azer (Iazer) remaining today.” </p>

<p id="paragraph-165">Indeed, the very geographical situation and some archaeological evidence for a Hellenistic period habitation might suggest the identity of Kh. Sar with the fortified settlement of Jazer, conquered by Judah Maccabee in 163 BC (I Macc. 5,8). Under the Ptolemies, in the 3rd cent. BC, the site must have been a part of the region administered by the mighty family of Tobiads, suggesting its possible identification with "Birta of the Ammanitis", mentioned in a letter from the Zeno Archive, dated to 259 BC. (see discussion in Młynarczyk, Burdajewicz 2018, 359-360).</p>
