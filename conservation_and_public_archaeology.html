                            Apart from conducting an archaeological dig, the current project will pay special attention to protecting cultural heritage of Khirbat as-Sar. The state of preservation of exposed architectural remains and any surface finishes (e.g., wall plasters and mosaics, if found) will be assessed, and the immediate environmental threats to the uncovered architectural features will be identified. This activity will serve as the basis for final conservation expertise with a proposal for a long-term preservation program that will be presented to the DoA.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The purpose of the conservator investigation in 2023, conducted by Dr. Julia Burdajewicz (Faculty of Conservation and Restoration of Works of Art, Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw), Â was to prepare a report assessing the state of preservation of the Khirbat as-Sar archaeological site and identify the principal types and causes of natural and anthropogenic threats responsible for its condition. The report presented to the DoA included the recommendations for maintaining and preserving the site by managing the present and potential deterioration factors.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the 2024 season, the conservator's activity focused on assessing the current state of preservation of the Khirbat as-Sar site in light of the principal types of deterioration phenomena, with a special emphasis on changes or damages that occurred since the 2023 season.

                            In 2023, a patch of floor mosaic was found in trench T2-S. It was treated and reburied

                            In the following season, the trench was slightly expanded, and the eastern and western edge of the mosaic was unearthed 
                            (<span class="pswp-gallery__item"><a

                            The reburial technique employed in the 2023 season turned out to be very efficient. The previously discovered and treated part of the mosaic remained in good condition and was relatively clean. It was thoroughly inspected once the secondary soil was removed entirely. All mortar bands applied in 2023 remained stable and coherent. No new losses or disintegrated edges were noted within the previously treated area. Conservation treatments were carried out in order to stabilize the condition of the newly discovered parts of the mosaic. At the end of the 2024 season, the mosaic was covered with the same synthetic sturdy mat as the previous year and reburied with a thick layer of soil (80-90 cm)

                                The community outreach program implemented during the project will enhance understanding the local population's attitudes towards their heritage. It may be possible to collect potential information on unrecorded (clandestine) archaeological findings in the vicinity of the site, as well as on the oral traditions and legends connected with the site. Another benefit of such an approach is the cooperation and relationship-building with the local community achieved through public archaeology. The engagement of the local community may enhance the protection and preservation of the discovered cultural heritage of the area.

                                The first step in the 2023 season was to conduct social research (by Dr. Katarzyna RadziwiÅko). Interviews were conducted with people of both genders

                                Among the respondents were excavation workers, shepherds, field owners, vendors/owners of nearby stores, and students. Interviews were conducted in Arabic and simultaneously translated into English with the DoA Representative, Mrs. Hana Lafi, acting as interpreter. The main objective of the interviews was to obtain answers to topics related to the historical and cultural heritage and its protection, as well as to prospective development of the site for tourist purposes. The conducted research was the first step to creating an action plan involving the local community to protect their historical heritage.

                                In addition, thanks to the assistance of Mrs. Hanadi Al-Taher of the SCHEP, the first "open day" was held at the excavation site, to which the local community was invited. During this event, the visitors were familiarized with the history of the site and the methodology of excavations

                                In the 2024 season, another "open day" was organized on-site with the support of Mrs. Hanadi Al-Taher. We hosted members of the local community and explained to them the history and importance of the site of Khirbat as-Sar.
