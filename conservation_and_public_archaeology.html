                architectural remains and any surface finishes (e.g., wall

                features will be identified. This activity will serve as the
                basis for final conservation expertise with a proposal for a
                long-term preservation program that will be presented to the

                out to be very efficient. The previously discovered and treated
                part of the mosaic remained in good condition and was relatively
                clean. It was thoroughly inspected once the secondary soil was
                removed entirely. All mortar bands applied in 2023 remained
                stable and coherent. No new losses or disintegrated edges were
                noted within the previously treated area. Conservation
                treatments were carried out in order to stabilize the condition
                of the newly discovered parts of the mosaic. At the end of the
                2024 season, the mosaic was covered with the same synthetic
                sturdy mat as the previous year and reburied with a thick layer

                  The community outreach program implemented during the project
                  will enhance understanding the local population's attitudes
                  towards their heritage. It may be possible to collect
                  potential information on unrecorded (clandestine)
                  archaeological findings in the vicinity of the site, as well
                  as on the oral traditions and legends connected with the site.
                  Another benefit of such an approach is the cooperation and
                  relationship-building with the local community achieved
                  through public archaeology. The engagement of the local
                  community may enhance the protection and preservation of the
                  discovered cultural heritage of the area.

                  field owners, vendors/owners of nearby stores, and students.
                  Interviews were conducted in Arabic and simultaneously
                  translated into English with the DoA Representative, Mrs. Hana
                  Lafi, acting as interpreter. The main objective of the
                  interviews was to obtain answers to topics related to the
                  historical and cultural heritage and its protection, as well
                  as to prospective development of the site for tourist
                  purposes. The conducted research was the first step to
                  creating an action plan involving the local community to
                  protect their historical heritage.
